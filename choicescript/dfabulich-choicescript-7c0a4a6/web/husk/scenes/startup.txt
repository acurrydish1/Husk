Looking up from the piece of paper on your lap, attached to a clipboard, you see a few other people sitting around you. You recognize a few of them from the Christmas party.
In addition is a Husk, sitting with its legs crossed. A name tag identifies it as "Tim Anderson". Tim is a nice guy, has to be out sick if he's filling today.

A voice on the intercom speaks aloud. "We at Hollander would like to celebrate Ming Yu's birthday today! We hope he has a speedy recovery."

Murmuring fills the room but very abruptly stops as a large Husk comes walking into the room.

*page_break

This Husk is unlike Tim. Tim is clean. Tim has little stickers his son made on his chassis. Tim seems to have the newest model.

This one is menancing. Rust coats its body in splotchs, the cosmetic kind. Arms, legs, and individual parts of both are mixed and matched. This one has seen some shit.

A twangy voice comes reverberating from the head. 

"Listen up now. The lot of you have made it in. Good on you. We've got some work to do. My name is Rich. That is all you need to know about me. 
We're going to have you split up into groups, help to [i] diversify [/i] your skillset. Let's see here... is there a... ${lName} present?"

*choice
	#"Actually, it's ${fName}."
		*set confidence +4
		"I don't believe I heard that correctly. Is there a ${lName} present?" Rich says, taking on a slightly more tense tone.
		
		You respond in the affirmative this time. "Good! Now, you can come with me, or stay behind. The other instructor will be here after I leave you all behind."
		*choice
			#Go with the Husk.
				Rich rattles off a few more names, as they quickly respond in the affirmative. The group of you get up and follow Rich out the door. Tim's with you.
				
				If Tim could show emotion, his face would be pale. Thankfully, his body betrays his mood, shaking violently.
					*goto_scene warmup
			#Stay behind.
				Rich nods at your decision as a small group of people leave with him. Soon comes your new manager.
					*goto_scene erratic
	#"Yes, sir."
		*set optimism +4
		"Glad to see you respond well. Time to pick your poison. We got two subgroups of study goin' down before we get to the fun stuff. You can either come with me and do some heavy liftin'..."
		
		"Or you can stay behind and wait for the next instructor. She won't be as stressful, at least not in the [i] traditional [/i] sense."
		*choice
			#Go with the Husk
				*goto_scene warm up
			#Stay behind.
				*goto_scene erratic
	#Stay silent.
		"Well, ain't that just a shame. Because I'm fairly sure that the person sitting in the chair directly across from me is a ${fName} ${lName}."
		
		"I'll ask one more time. Is there a ${fName} ${lName} prsent?" Rich asks, his voice growing more metallic.
		*choice
			#Stay silent.
				*set hostility +4
				"So be it."
				
				Rich opens the door and two more Husks emerge from the room. They walk towards you, and grab you by the arms. 
				
				"COME WITH US WITHOUT HESITATION." They both emit from their facepiece. Dragging you out the door, Rich stops them. He leans in and whispers to you.
				
				"Listen kid, don't do this. You won't like this result. Come with me, or you're in a world of hurt."
				*choice
					#Agree with Rich.
						"Good choice."
							*goto_scene warmup
					#Stay silent.
						"...I warned you."
							
						The Husks drag you down into a dark hallway, away from the group and Rich. The Husks' grip tightens significantly around your arm, and your vision grows dark.
							*goto_scene hell
			#Answer the Husk.
				*set confidence +4
				*set hostility +4
				"You are already on my bad side, kid. I was planning on giving you an option of your training, but I feel like I need to give you some special treatment. Come with me."
				
				Rich rattles off a few more names, as they quickly respond in the affirmative. The group of you get up and follow Rich out the door. Tim's with you.
				
				If Tim could show emotion, his face would be pale. Thankfully, his body betrays his mood, shaking violently.
					*goto_scene warmup
					
	#"${fName} ${lName} reporting for work, sir!"
		*set confidence +4
		*set optimism +4
		"Now that's what I want to hear! That right there is going to be the ideal worker for this group."
		
		Rich waves his arm at you, beckoning you over. Rising to your feet, you feel the eyes of everyone on your back.
		
		He puts his arm around you, pulling you in close and whispers into your ear. "As much as I would love to have you work under me, I feel like you're better suited for our next manager."
		
		"So, for me, take a seat and relax. She'll be in shortly for you." Rich says in a paternal manner. Taking your seat, you await the next manager.
